\title CSS Input

The CSS input plugin uses a customised CSS parser as an input format. These CSS
rules are mapped to Union's properties and selectors so they can be used by any
of the output plugins.

The CSS supported for wiriting Union styles is generally CSS Level 3 with some
newer elements also implemented. One important difference is the supported
properties. Since Union needs to map CSS to its internal representation, many
properties defined by CSS do not make sense. Others may have differences in how
they are used. See the page \l{css-support.html}{Supported CSS} for details on
what is and is not supported.
