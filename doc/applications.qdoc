\title Using Union in applications


\section1 Using Union without any application changes

\section2 QtQuick Applications

Support for styling QtQuick applications with Union is provided by the
\l{qtquick-index.html}{QtQuick Output} plugin. This plugin implements a full
QtQuick Controls style. To use it in your application, you can set the
\c{QT_QUICK_CONTROLS_STYLE} environment variable to \c{org.kde.union}. There are
also other ways of specifying it, see the
\l{https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtquickcontrols-styles.html#using-styles-in-qt-quick-controls}{Qt Documentation}
for more details.

\section2 QtWidgets Applications

Support for styling QtWidgets applications with Union is provided by the
\l{qtwidgets-index.html}{QtWidgets Output} plugin. This plugin implements a
QStyle that can be used with Qt.

\section1 Exposing custom types to Union

How to expose custom types depends on how the type is defined.

\section2 QtQuick Types

For QtQuick based types, you can use the API exposed by the
\l{qtquick-index.html}{QtQuick Output} plugin. Explicitly import Union using
\c{import org.kde.union} and use the \l[QML]{org.kde.union.impl::Element}{Element}
type to provide information about your type. You can use the
\l[QML]{Style} type to read style properties to style your type.
