\title Union

Union is a style engine designed to provide a unified style description to a set
of separate output styles.

\section1 Getting Started

To use Union in your application, ensure it is installed and then tell your
application to use Union as a style. For detailed instructions on how to to
this, see the \l{applications.html}{Using Union in applications} page.

If you wish to use the library or develop Union itself, you should start by
reading the \l{overview.html}{Overview} page. This gives a general overview of
how the code is structured, important technical concepts and relevant types to
use.

Note that currently there is no documentation about developing styles for Union.
This is due to there being only one input format plugin that uses KDE Plasma's
SVG styling.
